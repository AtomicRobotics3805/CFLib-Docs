# CFLib Docs

The documentation site for Atomic Robotics' [CFLib](https://github.com/AtomicRobotics3805/CFLib/)

CFLib's documentation site (https://docs.atomicrobotics3805.org) is built using Facebook's free and open source static website creation project **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**.

## Getting Started

To get starting with contributing to the docs, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtomicRobotics3805/CFLib-Docs.git && cd CFLib-Docs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start a development server so you can see your changes live

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server starts (this will take a little while), visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The first time you open the page, Docusaurus has to build the site's frontend and backend, which takes a little bit. This will only happen once each time you start the server.

## Development

Docusaurus is built on MDX, which is a format similar to Markdown that incorporates React support. Learn more about the Docusaurus formatting [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Contributing

Once you have finished your modifications, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/AtomicRobotics3805/CFLib-Docs/compare) and, if we approve the changes, it will be merged and automatically published to the live sites:
- https://docs.atomicrobotics3805.org/
- https://cflib.pages.dev/
