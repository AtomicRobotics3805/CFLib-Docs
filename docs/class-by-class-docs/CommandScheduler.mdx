# CommandScheduler
The `CommandScheduler` class runs commands, updates subsystems, and manages gamepad-related commands. The main functions you will be using are [`scheduleCommand()`](#schedulecommandcommand-command), [`registerGamepads()`](#registergamepadsvararg-gamepads-gamepadex), [`registerSubsystems()`](#registersubsystemsvararg-subsystems-subsystem), and [`run()`](#run).

## Root
- Extends: **N/A**
- Declaration: `object`
- Package: `com.atomicrobotics.cflib`

## Variables
### `runningCommands`
`runningCommands` keeps track of all of the commands that are currently running.
- Default value: `mutableListOf<Command>()`
- Type: `val`
- Declaration: `private val`
### `commandsToSchedule`
`commandsToSchedule` keeps track of all of the commands that are not yet running, but need to be started.
- Default value: `mutableListOf<Command>()`
- Type: `val`
- Declaration: `private val`
### `commandsToCancel`
`commandsToCancel` is the list of all of the commands that are currently running but should be cancelled.
- Default value: `mutableMapOf<Command, Boolean>()`
- Type: `val`
- Declaration: `private val`
### `gamepads`
`gamepads` is the list of the gamepads that are actively being used.
- Default value: `mutableListOf<GamepadEx>()`
- Type: `val`
- Declaration: `private val`
### `subsystems`
- Default value: `mutableListOf<Subsystem>()`
- Type: `val`
- Declaration: `private val`

## Functions
### `run()`
This function should be run repeatedly; once every loop. It adds commands if the corresponding gamepad buttons are being pushedm it runs the periodic functions in Subsystems, it schedules & cancels any commands that need to be started and stopped, it executes running commands, and it does all that with a smile on its face. The reason why it uses a seperate function to cancel commands instead of cancelling them itself is because removing items from a list while iterating through that list is a wacky idea.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `scheduleCommand(command: Command)`
`scheduleCommand` schedules a command. When multiple commands are scheduled, they are all run in parallel. Note that [`CommandGroups`](command-groups/CommandGroup.mdx) extend [`Command`](Command), so they can be scheduled the same way commands are scheduled.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters:
    - `command`:
        - Type: [`Command`](Command)
        - Default value: `null`
- Returns: `Unit`
### `registerSubsystems(vararg subsystems: Subsystem)`
`registerSubsystems` registers one or more subsystems. This list is used to run the subsystems' periodic functions.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters:
    - `subsystems`:
        - Type: [`Subsystem`](../subsystems/Subsystem)
        - Default value: `null`
- Returns: `Unit`
### `registerGamepads(vararg gamepads: GamepadEx)`
`registerGamepads` registers one or more CustomGamepads. These gamepads will be scanned every loop to see if any buttons are being pressed, and if so, their corresponding commands will be scheduled.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters: 
    - `gamepads`:
        - Type: `GamepadEx`
        - Default value: `null`
- Returns: `Unit`
### `unregisterAll()`
`unregisterAll` removes every subsystem and gamepad. This function should generally only be used when an OpMode ends.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `cancelAll()`
`cancelAll` cancels every command. This function should generally only be used when an OpMode ends.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `hasCommands()`
`hasCommands` returns whether there are commands that are running.
- Declaration: `fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Boolean`
### `cancelCommands()`
`cancelCommands` cancels every command in the commandsToCancel list.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `initCommand(command: Command)`
`initCommand` initializes a command. This function first scans to find any conflics (other commands using the same subsystem). It then checks to see if any of those commands are not interruptible. If some of them aren't interruptible, it ends the initialization process and does not schedule the new command. Otherwise, it cancels the conflicts, runs the new command's start function, and adds it to the list of [`runningCommands`](#runningcommands).
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters: 
    - `command`:
        - Type: [`Command`](Command)
        - Default value: `null`
- Returns: `Unit`
### `cancel(command: Command, interrupted: Boolean = false)`
`cancel` ends a command and removes it from the [`runningCommands`](#runningcommands) list.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters:
    - `command`:
        - Type: [`Command`](Command)
        - Default value: `null`
    - `interrupted`:
        - Type: `Boolean`
        - Default value: `false`
- Returns: `Unit`
### `updateGamepads()`
`updateGamepads` runs the [`update`](GamepadEx/#update) function for each [`gamepad`](GamepadEx)
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `updateSubsystems()`
`updateSubsystems` runs the periodic function for each subsystem and the `inUsePeriodic` function for each subsystem being used by at least one command.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `findCommand(check: (Command) -> Boolean, commands: List<Command> = runningCommands)`
Calls the `findCommands()` function and uses the first result, or null if there are none.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters:
    - `check`:
        The check function used on each command
        - Type: lambda
        - Returns: boolean
        - Parameters:
            - [`Command`](Command)
        - Default value: `null`
    - `commands`:
        The list of commands to scan
        - Type: `List<Command>`
        - Default value: [`runningCommands`](#runningcommands)
- Returns: The first [`Command`](Command) in the list (as defined by the `commands` parameter) that is of the same type as the `check` parameter, or `null` if there are none.
### `findCommands(check: (Command) -> Boolean, commands : List<Command> = runningCommands): List<Command>`
Returns a list of every command in the given list that passes a check. Also scans [`CommandGroups`](CommandGroup) by recursively calling itself.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters:
    - `check`:
        The check function used on each command
        - Type: lambda
        - Returns: boolean
        - Parameters:
            - [`Command`](Command)
        - Default value: `null`
    - `commands`:
        The list of commands to scan
        - Type: `List<Command>`
        - Default value: [`runningCommands`](#runningcommands)
- Returns: `mutableListOf<Command>` containing all of the commands that passed the check, or empty if none passed.
