# GamepadEx

By default, the Qualcomm Gamepad class has very little functionality. It tells you whether each button is being pressed, but not whether it was just pressed or just released. This class adds that for each button, and also allows you to set commands that will be automatically scheduled whenever a button is pressed or released. You should create an instance of this class for both gamepads and then register them in the CommandScheduler using the registerGamepads() function.
