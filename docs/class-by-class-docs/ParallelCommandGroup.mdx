# ParallelCommandGroup
The `ParallelCommandGroup` class runs a group of commands all at the same time. Since the commands in [`CommandScheduler`](../CommandScheduler) are already run in parallel, the primary functional use for this class is to place parallel groups *inside* [`SequentialCommandGroups`](SequentialCommandGroup), like this
```kotlin
val mySequentialCommandGroup: SequentialCommandGroup 
    get() = sequential {
        +FirstCommand()
        +SecondCommand()
        +parallel {
            +FirstParallelCommand()
            +SecondParallelCommand()
        }
    }
```
The above code will run `FirstCommand` until it finishes, then `SecondCommand` until it finishes, and then will run both `FirstParallelCommand` and `SecondParallelCommand` at the same time until they are both finished.

## Root
- Extends: [`CommandGroup`](CommandGroup)
- Declaration: `class`
- Package: `com.atomicrobotics.cflib`

## Variables
### `commandsToCancel`
- Default Value: `mutableMapOf()`
- Type: `MutableMap<Command, Boolean>`
- Declaration: `private val`

## Functions
### `start()`
Starts each command in the list (at the same time)
- Declaration: `override fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `execute()`
Starts each command in the list (if it hasn't been started already), then runs its [`execute()`](Command.mdx/#execute) functionm then adds it to the [`commandsToCancel`](#commandstocancel) list if it's finished. The reason the commands can't be cancelled right away is because removing an item from a ist while iterating through the list leads to all sorts of problems.
- Declaration: `override fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### `clearCommands()`
Clears the commands that need to be cancelled. The reason the commands can't be cancelled in the [`execute`](#execute) function is because removing items from a list while iterating through the list leads to all sorts of problems.
- Declaration: `private fun`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
