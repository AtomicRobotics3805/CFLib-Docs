# Command
The `Command` class represents a command; that is, a block of code that can be scheduled to run at a specific time.

`Commands` are one of the core features of CFLib, and something that the developers worked very hard on perfecting. 

Every command should represent one or more "action". 

Commands are different from methods in that they are scheduled by the [CommandScheduler](CommandScheduler), and run at a specific time or when triggered by specific events.

The same instance of a Command should not be scheduled more than once at the same time. 

`Command` is an abstract class; it is meant to be extended.

### execute()
This function is run repeatedly every loop. [`isDone`](#isdone) is checked before this function is run, and this function will not run if [`isDone`](#isdone) is true.
- Declaration: `open`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### start()
This function is run once at the beginning of the command execution (not when it is scheduled). [`isDone`](#isDone) is checked after this function is run.
- Declaration: `open`
- Parameters: **none**
- Returns: `Unit`
### end(interrupted: Boolean)
This function is run once at the end of the command, either when [`isDone`](#isdone) is true, another command using the same Subsystem is started, or when the OpMode ends.
