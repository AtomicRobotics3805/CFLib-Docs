# CommandGroup
The `CommandGroup` class represents a command that contains and manages other sub-commands. This is not generally used by the end user, but is instead a utility to provide common functionality for the [`SequentialCommandGroup`](SequentialCommandGroup) and [`ParallelCommandGroup`](ParallelCommandGroup) classes.

## Class
- Extends: [`Command`](../Command)
- Declaration: `abstract class`

## Variables
### commands
- Default value: `mutableListOf()`
- Type: `MutableList<Command>`
- Declaration: `private`
### _isDone
- Default value: `null`
- Type: `Boolean`
- Declaration: `override val`

## Operator Overrides
### plusAssign(command: Command) 
This function overrides the standard `plusAssign` command (`+=`) so users can add commands to the command group using `myCommandGroup += MyCommand()`
- Parameters:
    - `command`
        - Type: [`Command`](../Command)
        - Default value: `null`
### Command.unaryPlus()
This function overrides [`Command`](../Command)'s `unaryPlus` function to allow users to create command groups using the following format:
```kotlin
commandGroup {
    +FirstCommand()
    +SecondCommand()
}
```
- Parameters: **none**

## Functions
### end(interrupted: Boolean)
If the command group is ended forcefully, this function (which overrides [`Command.end(interrupted: Boolean)`](../Command/#endinterrupted-boolean)) will end all of the commands inside of the group.
- Declaration: `override fun`
- Parameters:
    - interrupted:
        - Type: `Boolean`
