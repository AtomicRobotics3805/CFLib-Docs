# ParallelCommandGroup
The `ParallelCommandGroup` class runs a group of commands all at the same time. Since the commands in [`CommandScheduler`](../CommandScheduler) are already run in parallel, the primary functional use for this class is to place parallel groups *inside* [`SequentialCommandGroups`](SequentialCommandGroup), like this
```kotlin
val mySequentialCommandGroup: SequentialCommandGroup 
    get() = sequential {
        +FirstCommand()
        +SecondCommand()
        +parallel {
            +FirstParallelCommand()
            +SecondParallelCommand()
        }
    }
```
The above code will run `FirstCommand` until it finishes, then `SecondCommand` until it finishes, and then will run both `FirstParallelCommand` and `SecondParallelCommand` at the same time until they are both finished.
