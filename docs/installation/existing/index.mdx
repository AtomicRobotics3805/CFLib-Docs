# Installing Into an Existing Project

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

CFLib can also be installed into an existing project using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

Most users use the `Groovy` syntax with Gradle, because it's older and [arguably] has better documentation.

However, Gradle also supports the `Kotlin` syntax. CFLib can be added using either.

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
